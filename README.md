# ATAC-seq Reference for cfDNA Fragmentomics

This repository contains the code and analysis used in the bachelor thesis  
**“Reference Data Type Influences Cell-Type Inference from cfDNA Fragmentomics in Health and Cancer”**  
by Donna-Tinke Huijsmans (TU Delft, July 11, 2025).  

We compare two single-cell reference modalities, scRNA-seq and sci-ATAC-seq, for inferring tissue- and cell-type contributions to circulating cfDNA, and show that the choice of reference profoundly affects the results.
